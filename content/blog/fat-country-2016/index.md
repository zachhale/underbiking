description: Self supported by bicycle from Seattle to Portland the hilly, dirty way

Rob Anderson was the mastermind behind this incredible self supported 7 day ride that took place July 2-8, 2016. The route took us through some of the most beautiful terrain along through The Cascades from Seattle to Portland looping around three volcanoes: Rainier, Adams and Hood. We rode a mix of dirt and paved roads every day with a lot of climbing included.

**The approximate stats:** 462 miles, 26,800 feet elevation gain, 7 days ([Ride With GPS](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/15080585))

**The crew:** Rob, Joe, Tom, Kale, Monica, Mollie, Langston, Rez and Me

## Day 1: Beacon hill to big creek campground, Mt. Rainier

**Stats:** 95 miles, 3,500 ft elevation gain

Starting out a fully loaded tour with a 90 mile, estimated 4500 ft day was just a little bit intimidating. I'd ridden 90 mile days, but never with that much elevation or more importantly loaded with too many snacks and a full set of camping gear.

Everyone was full of smiles first thing in the morning at The Station on Beacon Hill.
