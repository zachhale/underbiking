## :syringe: March 14: Vaccine Day!

The year started out pretty quiet and nerve wrecking with COVID keeping me pretty locked down, but on March 14 I was able to snag an end-of-day extra dose of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine choice has throughout the year caused me a great deal of anxiety and worry wondering how protected I was and wishing I'd just waited a couple more weeks for easier availability of the mRNA vaccines, but at the time it was a huge relief and enabled me to go tour in relative peace a couple weeks later.

## :bike: March 22-24: Spring Break San Juans Bike Tour

Feeling cooped up for a year and not taking _any_ form of public transport or ferry, Ginny and I took off to the San Juan Islands during her spring break for a short early season bike tour.

## :bike: May 1-2: Closed Highway 20 Camp and Ride

Another ride I've wanted to do for years but it never worked out well was to ride Highway 20 in the golden moment while the road is still closed to cars during its winter closure but after the road has been fully plowed, avalance chutes cleared, and road is clear enough to ride safely on before it opens to car traffic again.

We drove up the night before and camped at the somewhat winterized Buck Creek campground with a handful of folks and slept in the car. Camping didn't really save us any time and we were slower to get out than anticipated and ended up riding just Ginny and I, but it worked out fine.

The roads were perfect. Usually they finish clearing the roads the middle of the week and open it without any buffer for cyclists and usually the weather isn't great either, but this year they happened to finish clearing the roads right before an absolutely perfect sunny and relatively warm day. It was a huge joy to keep seeing folks I knew on the ride but hadn't ridden with or even interacted with all year. I felt so energized. We stopped at the first pass and didn't make it to the very top which was dissapointing, but it was the right decision because we had just enough time and energy to get down before it got too late. 4 hours of constant climbing was a full day after a year of COVID and it still being early in the year.

I will _definitely_ be doing that ride again.

## :red_car: May 28-30: Leavenworth Camp and MTB

Rob and Angela invited Ginny and I out last minute to join them at a campsite they grabbed first come, first served for the long weekend so we headed out for 2 nights to meet them. This was a big step COVID wise and was sort of the closest prolonged encounter either of us had in a few months, for me over a year. We had a great time car camping and drove out to Leavenworth Ski Hill on Saturday with our four mountain bikes to ride some XC trails and picnic. We stopped in downtown Leavenworth to get some to-go brats and experienced the overwhelming now-closed-during-pandemic downtown streets full of people – it was like Disneyland.

My Honda Element had fallen victim to catalytic converter theft a few days prior so I was without a vehicle so we rented a Gig Car Share for the weekend w/ it's pre-installed roof bike racks. 3" tires on our bikes was a bit overstuffed, but the rental worked out surprisingly well.

## :red_car: June 6-7: Port Townsend Grad Party and Beach Camp

With the vaccine uptake still in progress, Ginny's grad school in person graduation ceremony at UW got canceled so she and some peers got together at someone's place near Port Townsend. We took the opportunity to stay overnight and have a little day on the beach and walking around town and got some ice cream before returning. A nice little micro-trip.

## :syringe: June 8: Vaccine #2 Day!

Ginny and I went off script and got a dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine just under 3 months after getting our J&J/Janssen shots. I had been following international vaccine schedules and interim data from 3 studies testing the safety of combining J&J and mRNA vaccines. Everything looked great, so we went for it. A little lie on our sign up form, but afterward I felt a lot of relief. Symptoms were a more drawn out than the J&J vax, but faded 2-3 days later.

## :bike: June 18-20: Swift Campout Weekend San Juan Island Bike Tour

Freshly double vaxxed, we headed out for the official Swift Campout weekend and stayed two nights at San Juan County Park with Rob and Angela. We met up at the ferry terminal in Anacortes and rode out North via Roche Harbor where we took a long break and ate some tasty ice cream sandwiches on the grass.

We spent Saturday meandering unloaded and tried to get to Trout Lake which I'd heard a trip report of folks riding to, but we found out soon after leaving the main roads that it was actually a no trespassing watershed. We explored a little walking trail near the no tresspassing sign and had a little picnic in a grassy field before riding into town where I got a new cassette spacer and chainring from Meat Machine Cycles and we had some food and beer at San Juan Brewing (which I was very impressed with!).

Preparing my bike (Toyo Rivendell Atlantis) for this trip was a bit of a last minute saga. I tried to replace the triple rings on my 3x9 drivetrain but compatibility issues resulted in me going from 3x9 to 2x9 to 1x11 eventually replacing the entire drivetrain including bottom bracket the night before the trip. Well my late night shenanigans resulted in me accidentally not installing enough spacers on my shimano freehub body so my cassette was shifting a little bit and both slowly damaging the splines of my freehub body and causing my shifting to be pretty inconsistent. It was a pretty weird situation putting a modern 11sp shimano mtn cassette on an old 8sp M900 freehub. Apparently I needed a spacer that I didn't use and in my midnight last minute daze I mistakenly thought it was tight when it was, in fact, not. Meat Machine not only was able to combine a couple random spacers to get it just right, but they just so happened to have a narrow-wide chainring of an ideal size for me.

When we got to the campground the first night, the hiker-biker area was pretty full, but in the morning most folks left so we were able to take the prime spots down by the water and secure our own table and fire pit for the second evening when it got so packed that we heard folks were told no more could stay (unheard of! though a few did still come pack in tightly including Jess and Chris!). We had a nice relaxing day meandering around the island and got back in the mid-afternoon early enough to enjoy the sunset, campground happenings, and I got to go join a local volunteer for a casual talk about the local birds. Was fun to verify some I wasn't certain about including some common yellowthroats, pigeon guillemots, and quail.

The whole trip was pretty interesting feeling pretty safe COVID wise while masked and was a great time.

## :bike: July 9-11: Fire and Ice Cave Loop Bike Camping

Ginny, Rob, Angela, and I got together again for an overnight bike camping trip down near the Columbia River Gorge to do the [Fire and Ice Cave Loop](https://bikepacking.com/routes/fire-ice-cave-loop/). It was a 5 hour drive down and we got there late, but all managed to find each other at the pretty small Goose Lake Campground Friday night so we could head out first thing Saturday.

The ride out was lovely. We lucked out parking a quarter mile down the road and headed off. Along the way we made stops at some lava tubes and the ice caves site where we had a picnic lunch and explored the entrances of a couple super cool, chilly caves. I'd only ridden in the Gifford Pinchot once before on another [tour](/fat-country-2016) Rob organized and had wanted to come back so very much and this ride was just as lovely as I had hoped. After the ice caves, we had just started heading toward the berry fields in the north part of the loop when we stopped to wait for a black bear to cross a little ways ahead on the road. Luckily for us a group of motorcyclists came by and we boogied behind them, succeeding in not having any more bear interactions. As we gained elevation, the mosquitoes got super intense. The views of Mt. Adams were beautiful. We saw a couple groups of bike campers along the way to camp, but didn't see anyone at camp.

We camped in the berry fields. The area has a bunch of small lakes with rutty pseudo-roads heading down to several of them. We ran into a hiker who was deterimed to get to one specific lake which we also fancied, but let them have it and found a nice lake for ourselves. The bugs were pretty bad, but we still managed to jump in the water to wash off, though Rob got eaten up pretty good and got apparently hundreds of bites on his back.

The second morning it was so peaceful. I remember hearing Thrushes in the evergreen forests along the quiet paved road we got on shortly after leaving camp. It seemed we were in a little less accessible part of the forest now so there was fortunately less traffic than when we were closer to Goose Lake and the points of interest. We saw a woman with a small dog that needed help with changing a car tire so we did some water filtering while Angela helped the person. The water tasted excellent out there.

Most of the riding mostly pretty decent dirt roads with some pavement and a couple tiny easy single track sections. The second day though included a pretty time consuming boulder field crossing that required a group effort to get our bikes portaged across. The bugs were still pretty annoying but we made it through and once we got moving a bit more and made it a few miles further the bugs subsided while we climbed what was the dustiest, busiest road of the loop back to Goose Lake.

Once back to our cars, we all went to the lake for a quick swim to cool off before leaving the forest. We grabbed a beer and pizza with a couple friends of Angela's who happened to live nearby before heading back on the long journey home.

We all agreed it wasn't quite a _super_ easy intro bikepacking route, but we all made it and had plenty of time at camp and to see the sights. It was Ginny's and Angela's first gravel bike camping adventure and it seemed to have a left positive impressions. I'd go back sometime, though there are so many other places in 5 hours reach down that way that I still haven't explored yet!
